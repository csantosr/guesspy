# 🕵️ Guesspy

A social deduction party game built with Next.js where players try to identify the spy (or spies) among them Guesspy provides a fun, interactive experience for groups of friends.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Setup**: Gather at least 3 players (the more, the merrier!)
2. **Configure**: Enter player names and set the number of spies
3. **Assign Roles**: Each player secretly checks their card to see if they're a spy or not
